  <h2><em>Diary of a Wimpy Kid</em>, by Jeff Kinney</h2>
  <p>It’s a new school year, and Greg Heffley finds himself thrust into middle school, where undersized weaklings share the hallways with kids who are taller, meaner, and already shaving. The hazards of growing up before you’re ready are uniquely revealed through words and drawings as Greg records them in his diary.</p>
  <p>Greg is happy to have Rowley, his sidekick, along for the ride. But when Rowley's star starts to rise, Greg tries to use his best friend's newfound popularity to his own advantage, kicking off a chain of events that will test their friendship in hilarious fashion.</p>
  <p>n the end, Greg learns his lesson and decides to sacrifice the popularity he so craves by taking the fall for Rowley. It's definitely a gesture that not many middle school kids would make, and after he treats his friend so poorly it's probably the only thing that could've mended their relationship.</p>
  <h2><em>Fullmetal Alchemist, Vol. 1</em>, by Hiromu Arakawa</h2>
  <p>Dabbling in dangerous power has left Edward without an arm and a leg, and Alphonse missing his body entirely--soul bound to an empty suit of armor. Together, the brothers are searching for a stone that can amplify alchemy in the hopes of getting their original bodies back.</p>
  <p>Alchemy: the mystical power to alter the natural world; something between magic, art and science. When two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, dabbled in this power to grant their dearest wish, one of them lost an arm and a leg…and the other became nothing but a soul locked into a body of living steel.</p>
  <h2><em>The Last Kids On Earth and the Cosmic Beyond</em>, by Max Brallier</h2>
  <p>It's the first winter after the monster apocalypse. For Jack and his buddies, that means sled catapults, epic snowball battles, and one monstrous Christmas celebration.</p>
  <p>But their winter wonderland turns dark when a villainess begins hunting them. And this villainess is different—she's a human.</p>
